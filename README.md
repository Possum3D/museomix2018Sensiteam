## TODO

### 1. Print from code
https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-printer

### 2. Add a timeout to restart staled operation

### 3. Use custom font
https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/guides/using-custom-fonts

### 4. center images / randomize where image is, or even make it mobile inside its panel (to add fun)

### 5. Voice 
Definitive version aims to stimulate as many senses as possible.
That's why questions are meant to be asked orally; also a vocal calling is imagined to be triggered upon proximity detection of someone (detectors needed for this).
